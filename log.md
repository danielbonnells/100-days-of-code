# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: January 3, 2017 

**Today's Progress**: Researched how to go about creating a Wikipedia viewer for the FCC project.

**Thoughts:** It's been a frustrating day, as I can't seem to understand the documentation. Plus there are a couple of APIs, which adds to the complexity. I've certainly spent more than an hour looking, though! Hope for better luck later today or tomorrow.

### Day 2: January 4, 2017 

**Today's Progress**: Finally figured out the missing piece for my ajax to work.

**Thoughts:** The wikipedia API documentation is incredibly large. Despite me reading and reading, I didn't find what I was looking for until I watched a video on youtube about the project. That set me off on the right foot to get to work. 

### Day 3: January 5, 2017 

**Today's Progress**: Completed the Wikipedia viewer project for FreeCodeCamp.

**Thoughts:** The biggest challenge with this was interpreting the documentation, which, in my opinion, isn't very accessible to a beginner. I'm glad I pushed through it, though, and I am happy with the outcome.

### Day 4: January 6, 2017 

**Today's Progress**: Started looking at how to tackle the TwitchTV project for FCC.

**Thoughts:** It looks like this will be easy enough due to the fact that we're given a lot of information on how to start. I will probably have it done by tomorrow. 

### Day 5: January 7, 2017 

**Today's Progress**: TwitchTv nearly finished.

**Thoughts:** The most important parts are done, but the details are killing me. I've spent hours getting one small feature to work and I just haven't figured it out. APIs are annoying.
