# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: January 3, 2017 

**Today's Progress**: Researched how to go about creating a Wikipedia viewer for the FCC project.

**Thoughts:** It's been a frustrating day, as I can't seem to understand the documentation. Plus there are a couple of APIs, which adds to the complexity. I've certainly spent more than an hour looking, though! Hope for better luck later today or tomorrow.
