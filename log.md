# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: January 3, 2017 

**Today's Progress**: Researched how to go about creating a Wikipedia viewer for the FCC project.

**Thoughts:** It's been a frustrating day, as I can't seem to understand the documentation. Plus there are a couple of APIs, which adds to the complexity. I've certainly spent more than an hour looking, though! Hope for better luck later today or tomorrow.

### Day 2: January 4, 2017 

**Today's Progress**: Finally figured out the missing piece for my ajax to work.

**Thoughts:** The wikipedia API documentation is incredibly large. Despite me reading and reading, I didn't find what I was looking for until I watched a video on youtube about the project. That set me off on the right foot to get to work.
