# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: January 3, 2017 

**Today's Progress**: Researched how to go about creating a Wikipedia viewer for the FCC project.

**Thoughts:** It's been a frustrating day, as I can't seem to understand the documentation. Plus there are a couple of APIs, which adds to the complexity. I've certainly spent more than an hour looking, though! Hope for better luck later today or tomorrow.

### Day 2: January 4, 2017 

**Today's Progress**: Finally figured out the missing piece for my ajax to work.

**Thoughts:** The wikipedia API documentation is incredibly large. Despite me reading and reading, I didn't find what I was looking for until I watched a video on youtube about the project. That set me off on the right foot to get to work. 

### Day 3: January 5, 2017 

**Today's Progress**: Completed the Wikipedia viewer project for FreeCodeCamp.

**Thoughts:** The biggest challenge with this was interpreting the documentation, which, in my opinion, isn't very accessible to a beginner. I'm glad I pushed through it, though, and I am happy with the outcome.

### Day 4: January 6, 2017 

**Today's Progress**: Started looking at how to tackle the TwitchTV project for FCC.

**Thoughts:** It looks like this will be easy enough due to the fact that we're given a lot of information on how to start. I will probably have it done by tomorrow. 

### Day 5: January 7, 2017 

**Today's Progress**: TwitchTv nearly finished.

**Thoughts:** The most important parts are done, but the details are killing me. I've spent hours getting one small feature to work and I just haven't figured it out. APIs are annoying. 

### Day 6: January 8, 2017 

**Today's Progress**: TwitchTv project was finished, tomorrow is algorithms.

**Thoughts:** I found that I had to make some sacrifices for what I wanted and how I wanted to implement it because it just wasn't working. The project meets all the requirements, but I had envisioned more. So that's kind of sad.

### Day 7: January 9, 2017 

**Today's Progress**: Started working on some intermediate algorithms. 
 
**Thoughts:** Some of them seem simple, but aren't, while others seem difficult... and ARE difficult. Lot's of reading to be done in order to figure out how to approach some of these.

### Day 8: January 10, 2017 

**Today's Progress**: Worked on drawing with CSS. The algorithms can wait! 
 
**Thoughts:** Drawing with CSS is kinda fun! It's interesting keeping track of the order that things will render in and such, but fun overall. Certainly a break from the more mentally challenging projects.

### Day 9: January 11, 2017 

**Today's Progress**: Solved an algorithm exercise by thinking it through on paper. So good.
 
**Thoughts:** Not gonna lie, it felt pretty nice solving that one algorithm by myself in nearly one fell swoop. I feel like the more you learn, the easier it is to see where/how you should start adressing a problem. Very happy about that.

### Day 10: January 12, 2017 

**Today's Progress**: Complete failure day.
 
**Thoughts:** Nothing like hitting a brick wall when you're feeling invincible. Yesterday I thought I had this coding thing in the bag, but today's algorithm exercise has stumped me hardcore. I've been at it for hours and cannot figure out the logic to solving the issue. Really sucks because I've spent hours and hours on this. Feels like the whole day has been wasted.

### Day 11: January 13, 2017 

**Today's Progress**: Got yesterday's algorithm done with some youtube help. 
 
**Thoughts:** After more hours trying, I went to youtube. I saw how to get it done, and they had a much simpler, better answer than I was trying to come up with. Also did the second day of CSS Image challenge.
